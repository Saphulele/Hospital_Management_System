# Repository Design Justification (Python Version)

## Generic Repository Pattern

This Python implementation of the repository pattern provides several benefits:

1. **Type Safety with Generics**: Using Python's `typing.Generic` and `TypeVar`, we maintain
   type hints across all repositories while avoiding code duplication.

2. **ABC for Clear Interfaces**: The `abc` module helps define abstract base classes that
   clearly specify the required methods for each repository.

3. **Consistent CRUD Operations**: All repositories share the same basic operations:
   - save (create/update)
   - find_by_id (read)
   - find_all (read all)
   - delete

4. **Entity-Specific Extensions**: Each repository can add its own specialized queries
   while maintaining the core CRUD operations.

5. **Testability**: The abstract nature makes it easy to create mock implementations
   for testing.

## Python-Specific Advantages

1. **Duck Typing Compatibility**: While using ABCs for clarity, Python's duck typing
   means concrete implementations don't strictly need to inherit from these interfaces.

2. **Flexible ID Types**: The generic ID type accommodates different key types across
   entities (strings for patients/doctors, integers for appointments/records).

3. **Modern Python Features**: Uses Python 3.6+ type hints for better IDE support and
   code documentation.

# Project Title: Hospital_Management_System

# Introduction

Managing hospital operations efficiently is a critical challenge for healthcare providers. The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed to digitize and streamline various hospital functions, including patient records, appointments, billing, and staff management. By centralizing hospital data, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce administrative overhead, and improve patient care.

This project will leverage modern database technologies, secure access controls, and a user-friendly interface to provide seamless communication between doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and patients. Whether managing appointments, accessing medical history, or handling hospital billing, the HMS ensures a smooth and reliable experience for all stakeholders.

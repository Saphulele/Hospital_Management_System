# Challenges in Selecting and Customizing Templates

**Overwhelming Choices** – Many platforms offer numerous templates, making it difficult to identify the most suitable one.

**Complexity vs. Simplicity** – Some templates are too rigid, while others are too basic, forcing teams to spend time adjusting them.

**Learning Curve** – Adapting a template to fit specific needs may require technical expertise (e.g., YAML for GitHub Actions, JSON for Jira automations).

**Maintenance Overhead** – Customized templates need updates as processes evolve, adding administrative work.

**Team Adoption** – If a template is too complex or unfamiliar, team members may resist using it.


# Comparison: GitHub Templates vs. Trello vs. Jira

| Feature               | GitHub Templates (Projects, Issues, Repos)       | Trello (Boards, Cards)                          | Jira (Projects, Issues, Workflows)            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use Case**  | Code-centric workflows (CI/CD, issue tracking) | Simple task management (Kanban)              | Advanced Agile/Scrum project management    |
| **Customization**     | YAML workflows, Markdown issue templates       | Drag-and-drop cards, Power-Ups (limited)     | Custom workflows (JQL, automation rules)   |
| **Flexibility**       | Strong for dev workflows, weak for non-code    | High for simple tasks                        | Extremely flexible but complex             |
| **Automation**        | GitHub Actions (code-heavy)                    | Butler (no-code rules)                       | Jira Automation, ScriptRunner (advanced)   |
| **Integration**       | Best with GitHub ecosystem                    | Wide apps (Slack, Google Drive)              | Deep (Bitbucket, Confluence, DevOps tools) |
| **Ease of Use**       | Moderate (Git knowledge needed)               | Very easy (intuitive UI)                     | Steep learning curve                      |
| **Best For**          | Software teams using Git                      | Small teams, ad-hoc tasks                    | Large Agile/DevOps teams                   |

### Kanban Customizations
1. **Testing Column**  
   - Added to track QA progress separately from "Done".  
   - Ensures no untested code is marked complete.  

2. **Blocked Column**  
   - Improves visibility on stalled tasks (e.g., waiting on client feedback).  

3. **Manual Automation**  
   - Used GitHubâ€™s workflow rules to auto-close issues in "Done".  
   - Assigned labels (`bug`, `feature`) for filtering.

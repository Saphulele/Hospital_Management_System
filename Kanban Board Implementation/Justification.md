# Why Automated Kanban is Ideal for a Hospital Management System (HMS)

A Hospital Management System (HMS) requires efficient task tracking, real-time updates, and minimal manual intervention due to the critical nature of healthcare workflows.

# 1. Streamlined Workflow for HMS Teams
**Default Columns:**

To Do → In Progress → Done (+ optional Review/Testing for compliance checks)

**Maps to HMS Processes:**

Patient Records Update (To Do → In Progress → Done)

Lab Test Module Development (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done)

Equipment Maintenance Tickets (Auto-moved when assigned).

**Benefit:** Clear visibility into task status (e.g., "Is the billing module fix in progress?").

# 2. Automation Reduces Human Error

**Key Automated Triggers:**

Issues auto-move to In Progress when assigned.

Closed issues auto-move to Done.

**Optional:** Status-based rules (e.g., label urgent moves issues to top of queue).

**Benefit:**

No manual dragging (critical for emergency bug fixes, like a broken patient admission system).

Ensures no task is stuck due to oversight.

# 3. Agile-Friendly for Continuous Improvement

**Supports Agile Practices:**

**Continuous Flow:** Matches Kanban’s "pull-based" system (e.g., developers pick tasks as capacity allows).

**Sprint-Compatible:** Can integrate with milestones for feature rollouts (e.g., "New Telemedicine Module Q3").

**Metrics:** Cycle time/review stages help optimize HMS workflows (e.g., "Why does lab report approval take 3 days?").

**Benefit:** Aligns with iterative updates (e.g., weekly EHR patches).

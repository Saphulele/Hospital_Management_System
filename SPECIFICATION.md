# Introduction

# Project Title

**Hospital Management System**


# Domain

**Healthcare Management**

**The healthcare industry relies on efficient hospital operations to provide quality patient care. A Hospital Management System (HMS) is essential for managing patient records, doctor appointments, medical billing, staff coordination, and inventory tracking. By digitizing these processes, hospitals can reduce errors, improve response times, and ensure seamless communication between medical professionals, administrative staff, and patients. This system aims to integrate all hospital operations into a single, user-friendly platform that enhances efficiency, security, and accessibility while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations.**

# Problem Statement

**The purpose of the Hospital Management System is to provide a centralized platform that enables hospitals to efficiently manage patient records, appointments, billing, and staff coordination. The system aims to reduce paperwork, enhance data accuracy, and improve overall healthcare service delivery by integrating modern digital solutions. It will also ensure secure access to medical records, streamline administrative processes, and support better decision-making for healthcare providers.Many hospitals struggle with inefficient patient data management, leading to delays in treatment, miscommunication, and increased administrative workload. This project seeks to create a centralized Hospital Management System that ensures secure, efficient, and accurate hospital operations.**

# Individual Scope

**This project is feasible as it will utilize modern database systems, cloud-based storage, and secure access control to manage hospital records effectively. The system will be designed to be scalable and adaptable for hospitals of different sizes.**

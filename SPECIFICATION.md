# Introduction

# Project Title

**Hospital Management System**


# Domain

**Healthcare Management**

The healthcare industry relies on efficient hospital operations to provide quality patient care. A Hospital Management System (HMS) is essential for managing patient records, doctor appointments, medical billing, staff coordination, and inventory tracking. By digitizing these processes, hospitals can reduce errors, improve response times, and ensure seamless communication between medical professionals, administrative staff, and patients. This system aims to integrate all hospital operations into a single, user-friendly platform that enhances efficiency, security, and accessibility while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations.

# Problem Statement

**Many hospitals struggle with inefficient patient data management, leading to delays in treatment, miscommunication, and increased administrative workload. This project seeks to create a centralized Hospital Management System that ensures secure, efficient, and accurate hospital operations.**

# Individual Scope

**This project is feasible as it will utilize modern database systems, cloud-based storage, and secure access control to manage hospital records effectively. The system will be designed to be scalable and adaptable for hospitals of different sizes.**
